# condoman

condoman aims to be a project that eases condominium management. It's a **Work in Progress** built with [Python][0] using the [Django Web Framework][1]. Project skeleton was built using [Edge][2].

## Brief History

Its idea came to being on September 18 2019 when me and a group of apartment proprietors were banging at the office door of our building managers to find it was empty. They weren't gone in the wind but untouchable without going into court and incurring severe costs to all harmed parties.
Did I say they ran with all information and apartment history, meaning we had no way to know at the time who paid and when? Yeah. We're not sure at the moment if there are unpaid bills to contractors.

This software was created as a reaction to increasingly irresponsible building management companies protected by shoddy laws and slow institutions. That's why it's published under [ShareAlike][3] Licensing: to discourage its use by companies that plan to use, improve, profit and give nothing back in return. It's open and it should remain open.
